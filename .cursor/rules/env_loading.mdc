When working with notebooks or scripts that require API keys or other environment variables:

- Always import and call `load_dotenv()` at the beginning of notebooks or scripts that need environment variables
- Use `from dotenv import load_dotenv` followed by `load_dotenv()` before accessing environment variables
- This ensures that API keys stored in `.env` files (like `XENO_CANTO_API_KEY`) are available to the code
- The `.env` file should be in the project root directory
- Example:
  ```python
  from dotenv import load_dotenv
  load_dotenv()
  
  # Now environment variables are available
  import os
  api_key = os.getenv('XENO_CANTO_API_KEY')
  ```

This is especially important for:
- Jupyter notebooks that use the XenoCantoService
- Any scripts that interact with APIs requiring authentication
- Services that read configuration from environment variables
